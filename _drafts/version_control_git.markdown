Version control is both a process and system used to organize different versions of work files.

When it comes to typically saving files, we preserve the document one version at a time. Any previous versions of that file can no longer be accessed. You usually find a timestamp of the most recent alteration. However, a timeline of the changes is not available. In this fashion, it’s best for only one person to work on the file at a time.

But what if you want to keep track of the different versions of that file? It’s possible but tedious. All you need to do is save the file as a copy every time we change something. But who wants to do that? Not to mention the amount of memory we use. The solution? Version control.

With version control, all the different versions of the file are saved and organized. Each version of the changes comes with the timestamp, description of the changes made, and author of the contribution. This information can be accessed by the different members of a team at a glance and allows for a seamless development process. Another great perk is that we can make changes to a live project without those changes being available to the public prematurely.

Different companies follow different version control processes that work best for their team. The main goal of version control is to allow multiple members of a team to make modifications to a project individually and simultaneously and still produce a single project. It keeps one person from stepping on another’s toes and keeps the team up to date on any modifications the others make with access to those changes almost instantly. We call these collections of different versions of a project and their details repositories, or repos for short.

While many brands of version control are out there, the most popular is Git. This software comes pre-installed on Mac and Linux operations systems; Windows users will want to install the software to utilize the technology.

## Git vs. GitHub

Git and GitHub are commonly confused, but don’t let the names baffle you. These are two completely different tools.

Git is a version control software with widespread use in web development.

On the other hand, GitHub is a cloud that holds all those repos. Breaking down the name, we notice how descriptive it is. It is a hub or collection of different repositories made with Git.  It also allows others to view projects, request a copy for modification, and submit those changes for review and acceptance into the final project.

GitHub also acts as a portfolio. Because it holds the different repos and the contributions you made to them, it acts as a one-stop-shop for recruiters, hiring managers, and future clients to see what you can do for them.

If you do not have a GitHub account, I recommend making your free account as soon as possible [here](https://github.com/). It is never too early.
