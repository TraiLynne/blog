### 🚀 Week 2: Skill Sharpening for Full-Stack Excellence

After laying a strong foundation in Week 1, I’m ready to take on more advanced tasks in Week 2 of my skill-sharpening journey. This week’s plan focuses on building deeper expertise in React state management, TypeScript’s type system, Ruby scripting, REST API development with Node.js, and introducing Docker for DevOps practices. Each day’s task is designed to challenge me and ensure I stay sharp while searching for my next software engineering role.

Let’s dive into the plan for the week ahead:

---

### 🟢 **Monday: Advanced React – Implementing `useReducer` for State Management**

**Plan**: Explore state management using the `useReducer` hook in a sample React app.

This week kicks off with a focus on React’s `useReducer` hook, a powerful tool for managing complex state logic. Here’s what I plan to tackle:

- Setting up a sample app that includes a reducer function to handle state updates.
- Comparing the use of `useReducer` versus `useState` for managing nested state objects.
- Exploring how to handle side effects with `useEffect` alongside `useReducer`.

My goal is to enhance my understanding of state management patterns in React, making it easier to handle complex components in future projects.

### 🔵 **Tuesday: TypeScript & JavaScript – Creating Interfaces and Types**

**Plan**: Define robust interfaces and types for a React component using TypeScript.

On Tuesday, I’ll dive deeper into TypeScript’s type system by working with interfaces and types for a React component. My plan includes:

- Creating type definitions for component props and state to ensure type safety.
- Using TypeScript’s utility types and generics to add flexibility.
- Refactoring an existing component to enforce stricter type checking.

This exercise will sharpen my TypeScript skills, helping me write safer, more maintainable code and making me well-prepared for TypeScript-heavy projects.

### 🔴 **Wednesday: Ruby Programming – Building a Basic Ruby Class**

**Plan**: Create a simple Ruby class and use it in a script.

Midweek, I’ll switch gears to Ruby, focusing on object-oriented programming. My tasks include:

- Defining a Ruby class with instance variables and methods.
- Writing a script to instantiate the class and interact with its methods.
- Practicing core Ruby concepts like inheritance and method chaining.

This will be a good refresher on Ruby’s object-oriented features and help me prepare for any coding challenges or Ruby-related tasks in interviews.

### 🟡 **Thursday: Node.js Programming – Creating a REST API**

**Plan**: Develop a REST API using Express.js for basic item management (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

On Thursday, I’m diving back into backend development with Node.js, focusing on building a simple REST API. My plan is to:

- Set up an Express server and define routes for handling HTTP methods.
- Create API endpoints for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for a sample dataset.
- Test the API using tools like Postman or Insomnia to ensure everything works as expected.

This task will refresh my backend development skills and help me showcase my ability to build and test scalable APIs.

### ⚙️ **Friday: DevOps & Deployment – Creating a Dockerfile for a Node.js App**

**Plan**: Dockerize a simple Node.js application for containerized deployment.

Friday’s focus is on DevOps, specifically containerization using Docker. I’ll be working on:

- Writing a Dockerfile to containerize a basic Node.js app.
- Building and running the Docker image locally to test the setup.
- Exploring best practices for writing efficient Dockerfiles.

This exercise will help me get hands-on experience with Docker, a crucial tool in modern DevOps workflows, and prepare me for container-based deployments in future projects.

### 🛠️ **Saturday: Project Development – Building API Endpoints for the Closet App**

**Plan**: Implement and test API endpoints for the Closet App.

To round off the week, I’m shifting my focus to project development, specifically working on the **Closet App**. My goals for the day are:

- Defining and implementing API endpoints for core features (e.g., adding, updating, and deleting items).
- Testing the endpoints thoroughly to ensure they return the correct responses.
- Documenting the API using tools like Swagger or Postman collections for future reference.

This session will push me to integrate the skills I’ve practiced throughout the week and make tangible progress on one of my portfolio projects.

### 📅 **Looking Ahead: Gaining Momentum in Week 2**

Week 2 is all about taking the basics I revisited in Week 1 and applying them to more advanced and practical challenges. By the end of the week, I’ll have reinforced my knowledge across several key areas and made concrete progress toward building my portfolio projects. I’ll update this post once I’ve completed each task with my reflections and any insights gained along the way.

If you’re following along or have any suggestions for additional exercises or projects, I’d love to hear from you. Let’s keep pushing forward and sharpening our skills together! 💪🏽✨
