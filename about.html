<p>Technology is my passion and I pride myself in being able to build a website from thought to launch. I am well rounded in the field with Front-end & Back-End Development skills that include web fundamentals, React, Redux, Express, and Ruby. My mission is to continuously produce the best of my capacity by pushing past my comfort zone & being demanding of myself. I am actively seeking full-time employment to contribute my knowledge, expertise, and creativity as a Web Developer.</p>
