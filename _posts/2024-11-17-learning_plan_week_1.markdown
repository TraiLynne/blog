### Setting the Stage for Success

As I prepare for my next software engineering role, I’m kicking off a focused learning journey designed to sharpen my skills and keep me up-to-date with the latest technologies. In Week 1, I’m revisiting core concepts and tackling foundational exercises across React, JavaScript, Ruby, Node.js, and Git. This week will be all about building a solid base and refreshing key skills before diving deeper in the coming weeks.

Here’s what I have planned:

---

### 🟢 **Monday: Advanced React – Refactoring to Functional Components with Hooks**

**Plan**: Refactor class components to functional components using Hooks.

I’ll be starting the week by transitioning some older React code from class components to functional components using the Hooks API. This will involve:

- Replacing lifecycle methods with `useEffect` for handling side effects.
- Using `useState` for managing local state.
- Simplifying the code and improving readability.

This exercise is a great way to get back into the rhythm of using modern React features and will set me up for more advanced state management techniques in the future.

### 🔵 **Tuesday: TypeScript & JavaScript – Refactoring with ES6+ Syntax**

**Plan**: Rewrite JavaScript functions using ES6+ features.

Tuesday’s session will focus on modern JavaScript, specifically using ES6+ features to refactor functions. My goals include:

- Refactoring functions to use arrow syntax for cleaner code.
- Implementing destructuring to simplify variable assignments.
- Using `async/await` for handling asynchronous tasks.

This will help reinforce my knowledge of the latest JavaScript features and ensure I’m ready for codebases using modern syntax.

### 🔴 **Wednesday: Ruby Programming – Writing Basic Ruby Scripts**

**Plan**: Write Ruby scripts covering variables, methods, and control structures.

I’m planning to dive into Ruby and revisit some basic scripting tasks. I’ll be writing scripts that include:

- Variable declarations and method definitions.
- Using control structures like loops and conditionals.
- Practicing common string manipulation and array operations.

This will be a good refresher on Ruby basics and help me prepare for any Ruby-related projects or interview questions.

### 🟡 **Thursday: Node.js Programming – Setting Up a Basic Express Server**

**Plan**: Create a basic Express server.

On Thursday, I’ll shift my focus to backend development by setting up a simple Express server with Node.js. My plan is to:

- Initialize a new Node.js project and install the necessary dependencies.
- Set up basic routes for handling HTTP requests.
- Test the server locally using tools like Postman.

This exercise will be a great way to get back into backend development and lay the groundwork for more complex API tasks in future weeks.

### ⚙️ **Friday: DevOps & Deployment – Practicing Git Commands**

**Plan**: Initialize a Git repository and practice essential Git commands.

Git is a vital tool for any developer, so I’m dedicating time to refresh my version control skills. I plan to:

- Initialize a new Git repository and set up a clear commit structure.
- Practice key Git commands like branching, merging, and rebasing.
- Review best practices for Git workflows to ensure efficient collaboration.

This will help streamline my development process and ensure I’m ready for any collaborative projects.

### 🛠️ **Saturday: Project Development – Planning the Closet App**

**Plan**: Design the database schema and outline key features for the Closet App.

To wrap up the week, I’ll be focusing on project planning for the **Closet App**, a full-stack project to demonstrate my skills. My tasks include:

- Designing the initial database schema using PostgreSQL.
- Outlining key features and creating a roadmap for the MVP.
- Sketching out wireframes and user flows for the main screens.

This planning session will give me a clear direction for building the app in the coming weeks and help me showcase my ability to plan and execute a full-stack project.

### 📅 **Looking Ahead: Building Momentum in Week 1**

Week 1 is all about revisiting foundational skills and setting a strong base for the learning journey ahead. By focusing on essential topics like React, JavaScript, Ruby, and Git, I’m ensuring I’m ready to dive into more complex challenges in the coming weeks. I’ll be updating this post with my progress and reflections once I’ve completed each task, so stay tuned for a recap!

If you’re following along, I’d love to hear your thoughts or any suggestions you have for additional exercises. Let’s stay sharp and keep learning together! 💪🏽✨
