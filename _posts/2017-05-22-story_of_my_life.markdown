I have finally completed my Rails Portfolio Project!!!

I have to say, I am truly proud of myself. Seriously, look at how far I've come!!

Ok, on to business.

My project is a web version of my daily writing journal. At first I was going to take an easy way out. Make an app about video games or sports or something. However, my instructor told me to go with what I am passionate about. Boy was he right. Once I started, I just couldn't stop. I feel that when you are passionate about an app, you are never truly done. You may find a point where the app can be used for what you intend it to be used for, but ideas are coming all the time about features and functions to add. With this app, I can use it each and every day just as I use my actual journal. 


## Books
Each book is a year of my life. (I have a lot of journals) I typically title the book after the year I am in; however, I gave freedom to name the book any string the user would like. Along with the title, I give each book a quote. My quote is typically something that carries me day after day. Something I saw or heard that I just couldn't get out of my head. Each book belongs to a user and has many chapters. A book also has many pages through chapters.

## Chapters & Important Dates
Each chapter is a month within the year. The title of a chapter free for the user to pick as a string. Each chapter has a main focus for the month. It can be school, health, family, or anything that comes to mind. 

A chapter also has many important dates. I personally include birthdays, appointments, school check-ins and paydays. When the chapter is first created, it is preloaded with 4 important date fields. More important dates can be added on the chapter show page.  The important dates are always listed in order of the date they fall on. Important dates can be edited and deleted as well.

## Pages, Entries, & Tasks
Lastly, each day of the year is considered a page. Each page comes with a page number, calculated as the number of the day of the year - i.e. December 31, 2017 is page 365. Each page also displays the date next to the page number. 

Each page has many tasks. When the page is created, the form is prepopulated with 4 tasks that can be added at the time of creation. Additional tasks may be added later, however they cannot be removed or edited. I did this because I like to keep myself accountable for completing what I need to do that day. 

Each page also has many entries. Entries are listed on the page show template as a link of the time the entry was created. At the time of the pages creation, one entry can be created. From the page show page, additional entries may be added as well. Each entry show page displays the time the entry was created, the mood the user enters at the time of the entry, and the content of the entry.
