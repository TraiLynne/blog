A portfolio is a key component to displaying your skills and landing clients. No matter your field of work, this portfolio has everything to fit your needs. It's simple, sleek, and straight to the point. It can be altered and customized to fit the needs of any individual. 

This webpage was designed to be static, which simply means it will look the same regardless of looking at it on your phone, tablet, or computer. Some people prefer it that way. However, for those who like some change, this page can easily be converted into a Responsive site that adjusts based on the screen size it is viewed on.

# Get Their Attention!

The header displays an eye-catching tagline that is sure to capture the attention of the viewer as soon as the page loads.  Let your audience know right away why you are the one for the job.

# Let Them Know Who You Are!

![About Section]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/about.JPG){:.center-img}

Relate to your public by providing a little information about yourself here. Let them know you are human. You can highlight your background, your likes or dislikes, your journey in your career field. This can be literally anything you want to say, the sky is not even the limit. 

Tip: Make sure to use the word choice that best relates to your target audience. Do you want it to be formal or informal? Are you talking to friends or targeting a big corporation? Word choice makes a world of difference.

# Show Off Your Skills!

![Work Section]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/work.JPG){:.center-img}

Think of this as a mix of your resume and your trophy shelf. This is the segment where you get to show off, brag a little! Show the world what you can do. This also gives your viewers a chance to see if your skills fit their needs.
It can be a description of the skills you have, links to examples of your work, powerful praise from people you partnered with in the past, etc. Either way, be proud of your abilities and what you have accomplished. Display it for the world to see!

# Contact Information

![Contact Section]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/contact.JPG){:.center-img}

Providing multiple points of contact is key. Not everyone is a fan of talking on the phone, I know I'm not. There are also some people who only use their email address to store spam and coupons. By providing options, you'll never miss an opportunity to connect with someone. Plus if you display your skills via social media, you give people a chance to follow you and keep up with your latest accomplishments.

Regardless of your expertise, a portfolio webpage will launch your career or business to new levels!
