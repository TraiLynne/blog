After 5 years of working in a call center, I finally decided enough is enough. I was tired of the way my life had stalled. I knew I was capable of so much more and I was not being challenged with the route I was staying on. In the call center, I became comfortable. I knew if I applied for the job, it would be easy to get hired. I stopped striving for more. 



I'm not going to lie, I was very afraid to let go of my comfort zone and actually go for Software Development. I thought I was not going to be able to learn and absorb the information. However, once I began actually seeking the information, I realized I already had a basic idea of what was going on. In middle school and high school, I was always in an elective class that had to deal with web development. I knew the most basic information of building a site. However with the new information I was learning, I realized if I truly commit, I would have unlimited creativity. I could build a site as complex as Facebook or Twitter. 



The parts of Software Development that attract me the most are the unlimited creative powers I have gained and the fact that I will be a life long student. Technology is always advancing. Programmers are continuing to find new ways to improve upon the information we already use. Not to mention that it never gets boring. Everyday comes with a new problem waiting to be solved, a software functionality that can be improved. 



I have no regrets with the decision I have made to commit to Software Development. The amount of joy and pride I feel for myself are already a clear indicator that I have made the right choice.
