## Can you tell what's happening?

You notice that basically every HTML element has been set to have absolutely no design to it. We call this a CSS reset and it is used to create a consistent rendering experience across multiple browsers.

The above example is provided to us by Eric Meyer

Believe it or not, _Google Chrome_ has a different way of rendering HTML & CSS than _Mozilla Firefox_ or _Internet Explorer_ would. Without the CSS reset, the same HTML and CSS coded for a page could look very different (& in some cases horrible) on different browsers. In order to have the page look the same regardless of the browser being used, the CSS reset is placed at the top of a CSS file to erase any default settings the browser may try to place on the rendering of a page.
