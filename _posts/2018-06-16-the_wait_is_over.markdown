I've been M.i.A. but I promise it's for a good reason. I have been hard at work learning and improving my skills in order to confidently make my next move.

For starters, I decided to relaunch my portfolio website and I am extremely proud of the finished product. This needed to be done for a few reasons but mainly because I felt it did not properly reflect the progress I have made in my coding journey. I adored my old website but as soon as it launched I knew I could do better and I made it happen. I feel the current website is a proper representation of my skills.

I have decided to make a few commitments moving forward and writing them out helps me mentally commit. Plus it's on the site so I have to do it. 

Effective immediately, I will be:
1. Updating and improving previous projects (then moving on to additional personal projects, of course)
2. Keep my skills strong by completing CodeWar (https://www.codewars.com/)  Katas
3. Read more blogs, articles, and books
4. Get serious about freelancing!

I will continuously update the site with the products of these actions, so be on the lookout for new content and features coming soon!
