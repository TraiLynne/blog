# Explained:
Think of it like this, an object is a noun, a property is an adjective, and a function is a verb. An object is like a person, place, thing, or in this case a Magic 8 Ball. Each object can have multiple properties but the Magic 8 Ball only needs one thing, a list of answers.

The action that needs to be taken is asking a question. When you cut out all the extra, it comes down to just a few basic steps:
1. Ask a question - usually a yes or no question about the future
2. Shake the Ball 
3. An answer is selected at random
4. The answer is displayed - Usually very ominous and may not even apply to the question

There you have it, the Magic 8 Ball of the ... well now. I'm sure the future holds a lot more surprises for this timeless classic
