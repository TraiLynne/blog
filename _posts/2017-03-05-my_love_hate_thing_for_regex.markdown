Regular Expressions are turning out to be one thing I can not quite understand about Ruby. With everything else I have been learning (methods, variables, logic, and control flow) the concept usually clicks after practicing for a while. With RegEx, however, I am just not grasping the concept. 

Regular Expressions seem so simple. It is a way of detecting a pattern within a string. Programmers use them for multiple useful purposes. The one example that was provided that was the most interesting to me was detecting an e-mail address that is valid.

Whenever I attempt to come up with a RegEx for any code I am writing, I use the website provided in the Flatiron course that introduces Regular Expressions: [Rubular](http://rubular.com/). Since I do not have a clear understanding of what is happening, I tend to find myself guessing, typing in different letters and symbols until I am able to highlight the specific characters I want on the Rubular website. Once I have the pattern I believe I need, I copy and paste the expression into my actual code. I cross my fingers and hope it works, however this is not always the case. 

I have committed to finding more resources on Regular Expressions. I noticed that one of my main drawbacks is overcomplicating a simple idea. I tend to over think and overwhelm myself at first. Then when I take a break and come back to the concept, it makes so much sense. I am hoping this is the same experience I will have the Regular Expressions.
