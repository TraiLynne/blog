        <p>It would be an understatement to say that I am proud of myself. The amount of knowledge I have gained over my journey to becoming a Full-Stack Web Developer goes beyond words. I was making a list of the skills I have learned over the last 8 months. Each time I thought I was done, a new skill popped into my mind. Flatiron has been one of my greatest accomplishments. I am about 2 months away from graduating and it feels so amazing. I didn’t shy away from the challenge. All the times I wanted to give up because I felt like I wasn’t getting anywhere had to take a backseat. I refuse to give up on myself.</p>

<p>I faced imposter syndrome a few times. Each time I would go for a review of my projects, I felt like there was no way I would pass. That I would say the wrong thing and it would show that I have no idea what I’m doing. It made my day when I passed my Ruby on Rails Portfolio Project. Corinna, the instructor reviewing my assignment, rendered me speechless. She said she could tell this was the right place for me. She helped me realize that I am going in the right direction. That this isn’t just a phase, this is something I can truly go all the way with. I AM A WEB DEVELOPER. I have never been so excited about doing something in my life.</p>

<p>I am a very introverted person. Talking to people makes me nervous and I have a hard time asking for help. When talking to others, my mind moves a million miles a minute and I stand there dumbfounded without the words to truly express myself. This is my next biggest challenge. I admit, the thought of networking scares the life out of me. Talking to people I have never met, trying to create connections, it doesn’t come easily to me. My career coach helped by stating that if I hold back on details of myself, nobody will ever get the full picture of what I have to offer. It makes so much sense but my stomach and nerves have not figured out how to calm down. I don’t know what to say, how to begin or how to get rid of the feeling that I am bothering people by asking for help and advice. But in order to get to the next step, I am going to have to step out of my comfort zone.</p>

<p>It is a challenge in my current circumstance because I live in a small area. There are not meet ups I can get to, I have limited transportation and social media has never been very big in my life. I’ve been trying to find alternative methods to get involved in my community. I am learning to be more involved on Twitter. #CodeNewbies has weekly check-ins for coding goals. I’ve been on LinkedIn searching for fellow Flatiron alumni. I continue to be proud of the steps I take and avoiding negativity in my thought process. It has been an amazing journey and learning experience. I’ve come so far and the great part is that this is just the beginning.</p>
