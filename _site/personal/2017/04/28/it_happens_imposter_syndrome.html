        <p>So I have come to accept the fact I am a ‘victim’ of Imposter Syndrome.</p>

<p>I have felt this way for a while, however, it became completely clear as I was having my Sinatra Portfolio Project. My instructor told me I’m doing a phenomenal job and he could really tell I put a lot of work into my project. He said I was right on track with where I need to be. I  didn’t expect these comments at all.</p>

<p>You see, as I go through my lessons, I actually understand what is going on. I could not say that a few months ago. All that code would give me a headache. Now, coding makes so much sense to me. I have learned to slow down and understand what is being asked of me before I just jump into a lab. I find solving a problem becomes easier and easier. I take the ‘Red, Green, Refactor’ to heart. I can make my code work and then I can find ways to make the code better. My confidence in coding has increased so much, however, I still don’t feel ‘good enough’.</p>

<p>There is always a nagging feeling in the back of my mind that I just know I can do better. I am learning to take what I used to believe is a flaw and accept it as a gift. The best advice I can give is that if you feel like you can do better, then you are right on track. It means you have a thirst to learn more and more. Programming is not about knowing everything, it is all about being willing to learn and grow. To take the knowledge you have to make something work and then dig deeper to find a way to make it better and more efficient. Soon, the practice becomes second nature. Programming is about being willing to tackle a challenge. You don’t need to know how to solve the problem, you just need to be willing to look for the answer. I am starting to accept the fact that I know I can do better as a challenge to keep improving, to keep finding ways to make the code behind my programs more elegant efficient.</p>

<p>I still have a hard time talking through my code given my introverted personality. I get tongue-tied when speaking out loud. But nobody is perfect. People seem to think coding is all about being alone in a room in front of a computer. Coding is so much more. It builds up life skills that you didn’t even think you would have. You learn to approach a problem from more than one perspective. It builds a bond between fellow developers to where you can feed off each other’s thoughts and ideas.  Just like a basketball team has members who use their individual strengths to work together to win games, web development is a team effort where the strengths of individuals flourish into something amazing that can possibly change the world.</p>
